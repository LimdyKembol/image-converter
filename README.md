# image-converter
This is a simple script that converts all images in a given folder to JPGs, thus reducing them in size (even ones that are already JPGs) It checks for PNG, JPG, JPEG, JPE and BMP formats only and skips other files. If the output folder was not specified, it will be created in the same directory as the input folder with the same name + (new). Some images may lose saturation in the process, for those cases please check the box "Color Fix". If "Mark/Check Processed" is checked, all new images will get special metadata tag and all images with this tag will not get targeted by the program. The original images are not affected except when converting JPG to JPG and the output folder was manually selected to be the same as the input folder, in which case they will be overwritten.
